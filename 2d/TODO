***** general: *****

mdns and dns should use different "test" directories.

set svn ignore on linked header files in ~/dns


***** dns.cc: *****
memory leak in transfer?

won't compile on Orcinus due to fftwpp:: namespace issues.
      now a problem with tri/config/x86_64:

***** mdns.cc: *****

normalization
	the decimated grid modes are the mean of the undecimated modes.
	    the mean of the energy? or the velocity? (sqrt(2) issue!)

radix=4
	project / prolong
	what does GB do in project again?
	project now had the correct loop limits; copy these to prolong

spectrum: 
	  Src[EK] is curently set for all grids.
	  should move this info to just one grid.

subint=rk5 drives the time-step to zero and then segfaults. w00t.
	   (maybe just caused by too-high dt setting at start?)

radix=1
	spectrum not working right now for some reason.
		 (memory issues?)

forcing

radix=2

moments, transfer

Grid::block could be used as work arrays for more than one grid

add void Grid::loopw(void pFun(Real,int,va_list),int n,...) for functions 
that don't need k2)

add void Grid::hiddenloopw(void p(???),int n,...),  just like visible loop, 
but the other part (maybe)
