general:
mdns and dns should use different "test" directories.
set svn ignore on linked header files in ~/dns

dns:
memory leak in transfer?


mdns:
mdns Nx=15 doesn't work, but 31 and 64 do. (??)
implement project and prolong
nonlinearity double-counts when grids overlap
MDNS::Output
computeinvariants should only look at visible modes
forcing
spectrum
moments, transfer
Grid::block could be used as work arrays for more than one grid

timing test on ComputeInvariants

//void Grid::loopw(void pFun(Real,int,va_list),int n,...)
// as well (for functions that don't need k2)

//void Grid::hiddenloopw(void p(???),int n,...)
// just like visible loop, but the other part.


// FIXME: ic=<whatever> at command line hangs program, but fine if in p file.
