general:
mdns and dns should use different "test" directories.
set svn ignore on linked header files in ~/dns

dns:
memory leak in transfer?


mdns:

implement project and prolong
nonlinearity double-counts when grids overlap
MDNS::Output
forcing
mdns Nx=15 doesn't work, but 31 and 64 do. (??)
spectrum
moments, transfer
Grid::block could be used as work arrays for more than one grid
FIXME: ic=<whatever> at command line hangs program, but fine if in p file.

add void Grid::loopw(void pFun(Real,int,va_list),int n,...) for functions 
that don't need k2)

add void Grid::hiddenloopw(void p(???),int n,...),  just like visible loop, 
but the other part (maybe?)
