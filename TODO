***** general: *****

ekvkeq.asy doesn't seem to work on either dns or mdns

mdns and dns should use different "test" directories.

set svn ignore on linked header files in ~/dns


***** dns.cc: *****
memory leak in transfer?

won't compile on Orcinus due to fftwpp:: namespace issues.


***** mdns.cc: *****

subint=RK2 won't evolve but subint=RK{1,3,4,5} will. ?!

mdns Nx=15 doesn't work, but 31 and 64 do. (??)
     I get an error with "./mdns Nx=15 Ny=15" but not with 
     "./mdns Nx=15 Ny=15 icalpha=1 icbeta=1": this is a triad issue.

Grid::block could be used as work arrays for more than one grid

add void Grid::loopw(void pFun(Real,int,va_list),int n,...) for functions 
that don't need k2)

add void Grid::hiddenloopw(void p(???),int n,...),  just like visible loop, 
but the other part (maybe)
