general:
mdns and dns should use different "test" directories.
set svn ignore on linked header files in ~/dns

dns:
memory leak in transfer?


mdns:
mdns Nx=15 doesn't work, but 31 and 64 do. (??)
implement project and prolong
nonlinearity double-counts when grids overlap
MDNS::Output
computeinvariants should only look at visible modes
forcing
spectrum
moments, transfer
Grid::block could be used as work arrays for more than one grid
